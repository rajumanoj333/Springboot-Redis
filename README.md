**The Spring starters you mentioned in project:**

-spring-boot-starter-web
-spring-boot-devtools
-spring-boot-starter-data-redis

1. **ApiRedisApplication.java**:  
   This is the main entry point of the Spring Boot application. It contains the `main()` method and is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which enables component scanning and auto-configuration. You donâ€™t need to write much in this file except for the application launch logic.

2. **Dao/UserDao.java**:  
   The DAO (Data Access Object) pattern is used here to interact with the data source (in this case, Redis). This class should contain methods for interacting with the Redis database, such as saving, retrieving, updating, or deleting `User` objects.

3. **config/RedisConfig.java**:  
   This file holds configuration related to Redis, like creating and configuring the Redis connection factory, template, and other Redis-related beans. You will define beans like `RedisTemplate` or `RedisConnectionFactory` here to manage interactions with Redis.

4. **controllers/UserController.java**:  
   This is a REST controller that handles HTTP requests related to `User` entities. It defines endpoints (usually annotated with `@RequestMapping` or `@GetMapping`/`@PostMapping`) for interacting with the `User` resource, like creating or fetching users from Redis. It acts as an interface for the user-facing application.

5. **models/User.java**:  
   This file contains the `User` model class, which represents the structure of a user object in the application. It may have fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, etc., and be annotated with `@Entity` (or similar annotations) to map it to a data structure in Redis. It also includes getters, setters, and any business logic for the user object.

In summary:
- **ApiRedisApplication.java** is the entry point of the Spring Boot app.
- **UserDao.java** handles data operations.
- **RedisConfig.java** sets up Redis connection.
- **UserController.java** manages HTTP requests related to users.
- **User.java** is the entity representing a user.
